User configurable options include:

- Time to wait between swapping playlists
- Playlist names and spotify IDs

  - Configurable sleep mode.
    - Sleep mode will play a user-selected playlist at night, based on user-set time of day binary sensors.  
      This will override any currently selected playlist.
  - Configurable hours
    - Ambient music will play only during set hours, based on user-set time of day binary sensors.
